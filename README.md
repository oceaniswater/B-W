# iOS Technical Test
Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to complete this technical challenge. The project is written in Swift and follows the Clean Architecture pattern. It retrieves a list of products and displays a detailed product screen.

Once completed, please share your code either in github repository, or email the zipped folder to aleksandar@bloomandwild.com and let us know how much time you spent working on it.

## Tasks

- SwiftUI Migration: The current product details screen is built using UIKit. We'd like you to migrate it to SwiftUI, maintaining the existing functionality.
- Image Loading Review: Identify any potential issues with the way the project loads images for products. If you find areas for improvement, refactor the code to optimize image loading while adhering to the project's Clean Architecture structure.
- Integrate product rating: The API returns a "rating" field for each product. Your task is to parse this data and display it appropriately within the SwiftUI interface. This could involve creating a visual rating component (like stars) or displaying the numerical rating value.

## Bonus Points

- Implement unit tests for any code you modify or create.
- Improve code readability by adding clear and concise comments throughout your changes.
- Show us you take into account Apple's HIG by doing UI improvements
- Feel free to suggest any other improvements you see within the project's scope.


## Benefits

By completing these tasks, you'll showcase your skills in:
- Swift development
- Clean Architecture principles
- UIKit and SwiftUI UI development
- Code optimization
- Unit testing

This will help us assess your suitability for the role.

### Additional Notes
Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have during the test.
If successful you will be invited to walk through your solution with a couple of engineers and explain your architecture style and the decisions you have made. Please make sure you have the solution set up and ready to demo.
